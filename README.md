1. You need a spotify account to use the app. You can set up an account at www.spotify.com/signup .
2. Then you need to log in to the developer dashboard and create a new spotify app: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/
3. After creating the application, download "Client ID" and "Client Secret" and paste them into the .env file.
4. Then press "Edit settings" and in the "Redirect URIs" field enter "http://localhost:8888/callback" and press the "Save" button.
5. Now run the app. When you do this, a page will open where you must accept the terms.
6. A "token.txt" file should be created in the folder with the application and a list should be created in your spotify.com account.
